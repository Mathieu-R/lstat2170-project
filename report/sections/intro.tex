\section{Introduction}

The aim of this project is to analyse the mean monthly temperature in ($^\circ$) in the city of Recife (Brazil) from $1986$ to $1995$.

First, we will begin by an analysis of the data. We will first check for any trend, seasonalities or variability of the variance and apply ad-hoc method in order to be able to analyze the ACF and PACF plots of the data. These plots should give us a first intuition of a possible model to model our data.
We will then use automatic model selection using different criterions like the AIC, BIC in order to confirm our intuition and help us to select one or two final models.
We will then test our model(s) ...

Finally, we will ensure our model has good prediction power use it to predict the temperature for the city of Recife in $1996$.
